# Whatsfood
This is a food listing website built during my learning that permits restaurant owners to receive food orders from their customers directly in whatsapp. it is not exactly complete.  the module that calls for the user's order do not work yet but the form can connect to whatsapp so far. Your conntributions will be wonderful. It is built with native CSS and HTML and a little bit of Javascript without any framework.
I used Fontawesome icons in the project too.
